PyHeufyBot
==========

After being Java for a very long time, I think the time has finally come to port my HeufyBot project to Python. This project is a rewrite of [RE_HeufyBot](https://github.com/Heufneutje/RE_HeufyBot)'s modules and the core is built on Twisted.

Not much to see here yet as the project is very much a WiP. If you wanna play around with it, do the following:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtualenv and activate it
3. Within the virtualenv, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Keep in mind that if you're doing this on Windows, you're going to need the VC9 compiler to build Twisted.
4. Run `python bothandler.py`

Will add more here as time goes on.
