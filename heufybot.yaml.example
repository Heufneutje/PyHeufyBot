# This is the example configuration file for PyHeufyBot.  Make sure you rename
# this file to "heufybot.yaml" or create a new file with this name!  By default
# most lines in this config file are commented out and the bot will usually use
# the values you see in the commented line (not all the time).  Make sure you
# uncomment a line if you change something.


# CORE CONFIGURATION

# global settings of the bot, like the nickname.  A special setting is the
# "disabled_modules", which cannot be used as a global setting and MUST be
# defined in the servers dictionary.  Any module in this list will be ignored
# for that specific server.
